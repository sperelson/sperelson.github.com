I know a person who calls himself a software developer. I find this strange since I know I am a software developer and I have never considered this person to be one. I mean, why would a person with no coding chops call themselves a software developer?

I think the answer lies in understanding what this person's definition of the title "software developer" is. First, the official definition (quoting Wikipedia's Software Developer page):

> A software developer is a person concerned with facets of the software development process. Their work includes researching, designing, implementing, and testing software.

This is a pretty good definition, but this person I know's definition is very likely akin to the definition for a property developer (relevant bits cut from the Real Estate Development Wikipedia article):

> Developers ... have builders build projects, create, imagine, control and orchestrate the process of development from the beginning to end.

There is a definite similarity between these types of developers, but the differences are important. The software developer is a coder while the property developer is a more like the Film Producer (again, a Wikipedia quote for Film Producer):

> Film producers prepare and then supervise the making of a film....

In other words, a property developer prepares a project and supervises the project to fruition in order to achieve a goal, typically monetary profit. Just like this person I know with his software development projects.

Do I like that his definition is off? No.

Is there anything that can be done about it? Short of changing an entire industry to use a different term for software developer, no.

Maybe, just maybe, this person I know's definition should become the standard, industry-wide definition for Software Developer. As soon as that happens then we, the coders of the world can begin calling ourselves something better than Software Developer.

I have referred to myself as a Software Contriver before, but that was just a bit contrived. I'm however quite fond of Coder as a reference to any person who can write code for a computer. The term Coder is far more suitable than a specific IT job title. An example of such is my current job that has the title: Senior Web Engineer, which clearly defines an area of expertise and a role therein.

All said, nothing will change the fact that I get very disappointed when I meet a Software Developer and I find out that this person cannot code. It's like meeting a property developer only to find out that person only knows how to lay bricks.
