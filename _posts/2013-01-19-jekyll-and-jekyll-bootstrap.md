I realised that I encounter lots of semi-interesting and interesting technologies quite often. I make the mistake of not writing about my experiences.

I have also wanted to start using a static blog engine. Since Github's Pages use Jekyll, it seemed like a good jumping off point. I did a quick search for a helper framework and found Jekyll-Bootstrap that had some pre-built themes.

Setup was not difficult. Just followed the instructions and replaced my existing Github Page with the new files. Change the configs and removed/edited everything else and it was ready to be pushed back to Github.

I even went as far as setting up the CNAME record to give the blog a custom domain name.

## Share It All 

Now I'm going to write all about the technologies I've just used.
