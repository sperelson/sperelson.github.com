I've always liked the idea behind revision control systems. I don't think it matters which [revision control system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control) you use as long as it supports you and your team's development workflow.

I am quite practiced with using Git and Github for my personal and client work. The early days of Git were, however, not very user friendly. You had to be familiar with the CLI and Windows was not easily supported.

That has changed a lot recently with Github's introduction of GUI clients for Mac OS X and for Windows. And what really impresses with Github's clients are their simplified approaches to the most common Git operations. You still have the full power that Git's CLI offers, but you most likely will never have to use that power.

[Github](https://github.com) offers a central store for your code repositories and almost all the code for the projects I work on are hosted there. Some people are even using Github for unusual projects such as the person who is tracking issues on his [house](https://github.com/frabcus/house). I'm using Github to host the blog you are reading!

### What does revision control really offer you?

Revision control give you the undeniable proof of how code has evolved and who was to blame for that. Git also give you the power to test out concepts and new features without affecting the primary source code through the use of branches.

### P.S.

There are other really good Git clients out there and you are definitely not restricted to using Github to host your central repository.
