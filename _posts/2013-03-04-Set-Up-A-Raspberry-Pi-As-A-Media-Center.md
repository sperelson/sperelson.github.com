I bought a Raspberry Pi and got the Model B with 512 MB ram and, having tried Xbian and then RaspBMC, I am now using Openelec. All three of these Linux distributions are specially made XBMC controlled media centers. 

My RPi with XBMC is controllable via my TV's remote control. This remote control works because of the TV's implementation of the Consumer Electronics Control interface (CEC). CEC makes this whole setup extra special as we have a single remote for the whole setup and is easier to use by the whole family.

I'll add some more details about how I have set up the RPi as a media center and some of the pitfalls I have discovered in the next few days. To get the details started: we use the RPi to stream Internet radio, watch Youtube videos, play media from anywhere on the local network, and to play some videos stored on the SD card in RPi itself. The RPi has turned our not smart TV into something far more capable than a smart TV.
