Smartphone was a term that used to have a pretty specific meaning. Now it seems as if all marketing efforts refer to any phone that allows the user to accomplish some Web connected jobs as smartphones.

If I were to ask you to mention two smartphones, which would you reply with? Perhaps Apple's iPhone? Maybe Samsung's Galaxy range or any of the Android based handsets? Or maybe: Blackberry; Symbian; Asha; and the list goes on.

Not all of those are smartphones though -- not when I apply my definition of the term.

Would you be surprised if I said that Apple's iPhone is not a smartphone? I classify the iPhone as a mobile application platform with a phone attached. Due to its strict sandboxing, very few of apps can extend the phone functionality in any meaningful way. You have to jailbreak to get true power.

Want a custom phone profile during meetings so you phone goes to silent automatically based on your calendar? If you know better, let me know, but I don't think it is possible to add an app to an iPhone that can do that.

I'm not saying the iPhone isn't an incredible application platform for mobile apps. It is fantastic for that. It just doesn't do anything to make itself a smartphone. Android helps make the phone smarter. Even Symbian gave the app developers the power to improve the phone's capabilities.

So, if you want a smart**phone** then choose a phone that gives you the power to extend its phone. In the meantime, lets choose a more appropriate name for mobile application devices. How about Marvin?
