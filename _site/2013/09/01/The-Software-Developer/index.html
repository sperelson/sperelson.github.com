    <p>I know a person who calls himself a software developer. I find this strange since I know I am a software developer and I have never considered this person to be one. I mean, why would a person with no coding chops call themselves a software developer?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I think the answer lies in understanding what this person&#8217;s definition of the title &#8220;software developer&#8221; is. First, the official definition (quoting Wikipedia&#8217;s Software Developer page):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A software developer is a person concerned with facets of the software development process. Their work includes researching, designing, implementing, and testing software.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a pretty good definition, but this person I know&#8217;s definition is very likely akin to the definition for a property developer (relevant bits cut from the Real Estate Development Wikipedia article):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Developers &#8230; have builders build projects, create, imagine, control and orchestrate the process of development from the beginning to end.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a definite similarity between these types of developers, but the differences are important. The software developer is a coder while the property developer is a more like the Film Producer (again, a Wikipedia quote for Film Producer):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Film producers prepare and then supervise the making of a film&#8230;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, a property developer prepares a project and supervises the project to fruition in order to achieve a goal, typically monetary profit. Just like this person I know with his software development projects.</p>

<p>Do I like that his definition is off? No.</p>

<p>Is there anything that can be done about it? Short of changing an entire industry to use a different term for software developer, no.</p>

<p>Maybe, just maybe, this person I know&#8217;s definition should become the standard, industry-wide definition for Software Developer. As soon as that happens then we, the coders of the world can begin calling ourselves something better than Software Developer.</p>

<p>I have referred to myself as a Software Contriver before, but that was just a bit contrived. I&#8217;m however quite fond of Coder as a reference to any person who can write code for a computer. The term Coder is far more suitable than a specific IT job title. An example of such is my current job that has the title: Senior Web Engineer, which clearly defines an area of expertise and a role therein.</p>

<p>All said, nothing will change the fact that I get very disappointed when I meet a Software Developer and I find out that this person cannot code. It&#8217;s like meeting a property developer only to find out that person only knows how to lay bricks.</p>
